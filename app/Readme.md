# Application Proposal

1.	Your selected mobile application — its name and its origin, and why you want to develop that application.
Name: QuizApp
Description: this is an application allows a player to chose a topic and answer the multiple choice questions.
At the end of the quiz he would be able to see his score. 

2.	Your initial architectural design for the application
The administrator would be able to upload questions on a firebase database.
The scores would also be saved for each registered user.
His previous scores and record would be saved in SQLite local db.
Number of Activities would be Login, Chose name, Chose topic, Play and Score.

3.	Your description of any initial implementation you have done for the application.
4.	Your thoughts on some of the complications in developing the application.
Login and registration could be difficult as I have not done it before.
Uploading the questions in JSON format via mobile is a bit difficult.
5.	Your thoughts on acquiring knowledge and skills in order to complete the application—what do you need to learn in order to develop the application.
6.	Your thoughts on any easy Android/Kotlin/Java concepts that you can use for your mobile application.
7.	Your thoughts on any difficult Android/Kotlin/Java concepts that you may need to learn to complete the application.
8.	Your thoughts on the achievability of the application in the time frame.
9.	Your thoughts on the risks you face in developing the application in the time frame available.
